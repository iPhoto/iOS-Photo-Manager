// of Album class binding with the created instance in Core Data.
//

// sets of albums and photos inside the new album, while |albumsBelongsTo| are
// sets of albums the new album belongs to. |albums|, |photos| and
// |albumsBelonsTo| should be guaranteed to contains only instance of Album,
// Photo and Album class.
//
// If one album A from |albumsBelongsTo| is equal to or a direct/indirect child
// of another album B from |albums|, then creating a new album in A having B
// inside it will introuce a circulation. Such A and B are defined as a pair of
// conflict albums, where A is called Parent while B is called "Child".
//
// If there is any pair of conflict albums, the new album will not be created.
// This method will set |conflicts| to a set of all pairs of conflict albums,
// each pair is a NSDictionary with @"Parent" and @"Child" mapping to Parent
// and Child of the conflict. Then the method will return nil.
//
// If there is no conflict albums, |conflicts| is set to nil.
//
// This method uses |context| to access the entity in Core Data.
//
// This method will do nothing and return nil if either |title| or |context| is
// nil.
